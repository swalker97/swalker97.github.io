        <div class='summary'><p>The aim of this project was to create a visual composition using the three phrases,
        Racism Divides, Divisions Cause Fractures, Fractures Destroy Societies. The phrases could be repeated as many times as needed. The composition must consist of only type. We used this project to practice approaches to visual hierarchy.

    <h2>Phase 1</h2>
    <div class='phase1info'>
    <p>After receiving the task, I began by researching political posters relating to the three phrases. Campaigns like #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo were at the height of coverage during this time. I was considering my reaction to these movements and the way society tends to divide on opinion. However, the unpopular, yet valid opinion is sometimes hidden due to fear of retaliation or misunderstanding. In a country built on freedom of speech, I began to wonder about the impacts of being too afraid to offer an opinion that may diverge from majority, With this issue in mind, I began to sketch.</p></div>

        </div>
    
    <div class='sketches'>
    <p>The first sketch was attempting to tie social media into the hidden opinions, the second is broken into two that represent someone being quieted or cut off (i.e. microphone being cut and a zipped mouth), the third was simpler using only tape to cover the person’s mouth, and the fourth was a bug being squished to represent someone’s opinion being shut down. After discussing my ideas with classmates, I realized using only type to create these forms would become complicated and cause the value of the phrases to become lost. I felt the muting of the microphone by cutting the wire and someone’s mouth being covered were my strongest inspirations. However, I wanted to make the composition as basic as possible to showcase the phrases while also communicating clearly with the viewer.</p></div>

    <div class='digitalsketches'>
    <p>We then used Adobe Photoshop to digitally compose off of our original sketches. Using different cues of sound being muted, I created four iterations of my concept using only the three phrases to create the forms (see below). The first is the muting of a microphone, the second a mute symbol, the third is a megaphone with a prohibited symbol overlaying it, and the fourth is a megaphone with white noise textured font coming out.</p></div>

    <h2>Phase 2</h2>
    <div class='phase2info'>
        <p>Our class went through another round of critiques. My peers felt the the muted symbol was the best way to communicate my concept. And while I also liked the simplicity and universality of the design, I felt that it lacked the idea of muting speech. My classmates didn’t need this extra cue because I was there to explain the concept. However, I wanted this composition to be able to stand on its own and speak for itself, without me explaining. So I used Photoshop to form a speech bubble from the text and overlay an image of a mute symbol.</p></div>

            </div>
        
    <h2>Final Design</h2>
    <div class='final'>
        <p>I felt combining a speech bubble with the mute symbol best conveyed my message. I continued to develop the composition with the intent of making it more engaging. I began to manipulate the composition to warp the phrases creating a mute symbol by manipulating the white space, rather than inserting a mute symbol. After settling on a design, I began to consider color. While I risked being too obvious, I felt using red, blue, and the white space for color was the most appropriate choice for my idea. However, I softened the tone of the red and blue to convey an existing fragility to even this statement, as I knew some of my classmates did not agree with my concept. This recognition aligned with my original message of the greater fear felt of those with minority opinions and is the reason I entitled my piece “The Muting Impacts of Political Correctness”.</p></div>
