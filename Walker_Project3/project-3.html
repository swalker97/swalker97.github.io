        <h2>Phase 1: Research</h2>
        <div class='content1'>
        <p>I was initially struck by the vintage style of Righteous when I was exploring fonts on Google Fonts. The description on Google Fonts mentioned the font was inspired by the deco posters of Hungarian artist Robert Bereny, specifically a piece entitled “Modiano”.</p></div> 
            <div class='content1img'>

            </div>
        
        <div class='content2'>
        <p>I began to research this period in art history to better understand the font development. Art Deco and Art Moderne represented a period between 1920 and 1945 and derived from the 1925 an art exposition held in Paris. The style incorporated cubism and avant-garde painting styles, along with smooth lines used in Arte Nouveau styles. The style was also incorporated into architecture. The first building to represent Art Deco in America was the Nebraska State Capitol Building in 1919. Other identifying features of the style included intense colors, smooth stones, metal casements, monumentality, vertical lines, ornamentation, mosaics, and relief carvings. As fairs and exhibitions, like the Chicago World Fair, began to pop up in America, the style of Art Moderne began to gain popularity. The smooth finished, line emphasis, and metal frames included only subtle differentiating features that made the style hard to isolate from Art Deco.</p></div>

        <div class='content3'>
        <p>An emergence of graphic design occurred in the late 19th into early 20th century and had led to the modern “poster” design. Post industrial revolution and World Wars caused a demand for campaigns, which brought advertisements and graphic design to every day life. These posters are seen in Bereny’s work along with US Army Recruitment posters, like “Wake Up America” by James Montgomery Flag. The Great Depression in the 1930s also influenced posters and campaigns. The Franklin D. Roosevelt administration created the Works Project Administration to help stimulate the economy, especially for artists. This initiative led to a series of graphic art pieces promoting national parks within the United States, like Alexander Dux’s “See America”.</p>

            </div>
        
        <div class='content4'>
        <p>I consolidated my research choosing keep points from the Righteous font family history to be used as the body copy for my letterform analysis:
        “Righteous was designed by the Astigmatic One Eye Typographic Institute. It was initially inspired by the all capitals letterforms in the 1932 poster by Hungarian artist Robert Berény, “Modiano”. The Art Deco style transitioned into the 1930s style of Art Moderne, which is reflected in the grid based, geometric forms of this font family. Block colors featuring shades of red, gold, and black and smooth lines are representative of this movement. I chose Righteous because of its vintage inspiration and whimsy features.”</p></div>
        
        <h2>Phase 2: Analysis</h2>
        <div class='content4a'>
        <p>To draw attention to distinguishing features of the font family, I noticed asymmetric features and differing widths. I used lines to highlight the individual widths and circles to emphasize the angled ends on the vertical line in an “a” form.</p>
        </div>
            <div class='content4img'>

        <h2>Phase 3: Wireframe Sketches</h2>
        <div class='content5'>
        <p>I used the history to inspire my wireframe sketches. For the Art Deco designs, I focused on ornamenting the letter with artifacts indicative of the era. Some of these artifacts included cigarette holders, hats, gloves, pearls, mustaches and canes.</p>

            <img src="Web_Project/Project1_WorkFiles/Tumblr-post/flappermen.png"/>  
            <figcaption>While most of my wireframes focused on time-period accessories, I chose to focus one of my designs on Art Moderne’s influence on architecture.</figcaption></div>
        
        <div class='content6'>
        <p>The font in itself has a whimsical nature, so I explored this as well. The lowercase “a” in Righteous reminded me of a childish drawing of a fish, so my sketches became influenced by a fun, nostalgic feeling.</p></div>

            </div>
        
        <h2>Phase 4: Styles</h2>
        <div class='content7'>
        <p>I began to transfer wireframe sketches to digital style tiles using Adobe XD. I used gilded and bold colors along with more sultry black, grey, and red shades seen in many posters of the time. For the fish, I began to explore indicative colors of sea-life and settled on a classic goldfish orange. To contrast the bright orange, I used the blue of the ocean and referred to a color wheel to choose the shade of blue I felt would be best for the page.</p></div>
        
        <div class='content8'>
        <p>I settled on a darker toned navy-violet. However, I wanted to maintain an emphasis on the “a” form, so I did not use the orange color for the rest of the content on my page. I chose a contrasting sea foam color that would stand out against the navy background while remaining within the range of blue shades.</p></div>
            <div class='content8img'>

            <img src="Web_Project/Project1_WorkFiles/Tumblr-post/projectimage.png"/> 
            </div>

        <div class='content9'>
        <p>While I was initially drawn to the vintage, flapper society style characterized in Righteous, I decided to focus on the more whimsical nature of the font after comparing the style tiles.</p></div>
        <div class='content9'>    
        <p>Adding to the whimsy and extending the oceanic design of my page, I incorporated more features that would indicate to the viewer that the “a” is representing a fish in water. I added waves and bubbles to bring the page to life. Since the bubbles were placed closer to the letterform, I wanted to use one of the bubbles as the button for my letter analysis.</p></div>
        <div class='content9'>
        <p>After critiques, I felt the need to make the button clearer, so I added a white speck on the bubble and a subtle drop shadow to create a 3D effect that would differentiate the button from the rest of the bubbles. The purpose of this detail was to influence a viewer’s interaction with my page.</p>
        </div>

        <div class='content10'>
        <p>Other interactions include the underline that appears when viewer’s mouse over hyperlinks, and the ability to scroll through the font family “showcase” at the top of the page.</p></div>
        
        <div class='content10img'>
        <img src="Web_Project/Project1_WorkFiles/Tumblr-post/boxstructure.png"/>
        <figcaption>To aid in my understanding of how to layout my html, I created a box wireframe on my final XD style tile to separate the content.</figcaption>
        </div>
    
        
        <h2>Phase 5: Functional Site</h2>
        <div class='content11'>
        <p>Doing so helped make the transfer from static design to live code more comprehensible and easier to manipulate. After coding a box html skeleton, I began to include my content and various assets I created in Photoshop and Illustrator. I added jquery to allow my button analysis to have a behavior.</p>
