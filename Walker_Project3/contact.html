        <p>Sam is from Rockland County, New York. She is a senior Accountancy major and Design minor at the University of Notre Dame. She will begin her career as an Audit Associate at Pricewaterhouse Coopers. Sam was the President of the Women in Business club at Notre Dame. After reorganizing the board to help her maximize the impact of the club’s “revamp”, her team became responsible for improving member attendance at events. They also expanded their company network by reaching out to Public Relation firms, Rx Bar, tech roles at Google, and more. Their keynote speaker this year tapped into a growing industry of “influencers”. The speaker is a full time attorney, while also building her influencer career. Sam is extremely passionate about women in business and hopes to use the event planning and networking skills she has developed through this club to join NDNY’s Women Connect Board and continue to be a resource for future women in business. Sam is interested in business ethics and presented a case study paper at the International Vincentian Business Ethics Conference at DePaul University in Chicago. She hopes to obtain her Certified Fraud Examiner license as well as her Certified Public Accountant license after graduation. She is also interested in design thinking and public relations and strategic planning. Sam enjoys tennis, running, and travel. She relaxes at the beach with a new book. </p>
